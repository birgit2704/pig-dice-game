            There are two players. The player whose turn it is rolls the
            dice.<br /><br />
            The total of the roll is added to the current player's score, unless
            either die comes up as a “one”. If this happens, this player's turn
            is over, and it is the other player’s turn.<br /><br />
            After each roll, the current player can either roll again, (assuming
            a “one” was not rolled) or if the current player feels that luck is
            running thin, they can pass to the other player.<br /><br />
            The first player to get 30 points or higher wins. <br /><br />
            Oh, and if you roll two “ones” (snake eyes), your current score gets
            zeroed out. So don’t do that.
